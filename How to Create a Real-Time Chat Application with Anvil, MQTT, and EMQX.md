# How to Create a Real-Time Chat Application with Anvil, MQTT, and EMQX

## Introduction
- Brief overview of the project: creating a real-time chat application using Anvil, MQTT, and EMQX.
- Explanation of the technologies involved: Anvil for the front end, Paho MQTT JavaScript client library for MQTT communication, and EMQX MQTT broker for message exchange.

## Setting Up Anvil Environment
- Install Anvil and create a new Anvil app.
- Design the chat interface using Anvil's visual editor.
- Add components such as text boxes, labels, and buttons for user interaction.

## Configuring MQTT Communication
- Import the necessary modules from Anvil and Paho MQTT library.
- Define functions to handle MQTT connection, message arrival, and disconnection.
- Set up a unique client ID and topic for the chat room.

## User Name and Initialization
- Prompt the user to enter their name using a text box.
- Store the user's name in local storage for future sessions.
- Initialize the MQTT client and connect to the EMQX MQTT broker.

## Sending Messages
- Implement the functionality to send messages when the user clicks the send button or presses enter.
- Check for errors such as missing user name or uninitialized MQTT client.
- Create and send MQTT messages with the user's name and message content.

## Receiving Messages
- Subscribe to the chat topic to receive messages from other users.
- Display received messages in the chat interface with the sender's name and message content.
- Scroll the chat window to show the latest messages automatically.

## Clean Up and Disconnect
- Disconnect the MQTT client when the chat window is closed or the user navigates away.
- Handle any connection errors or interruptions gracefully.
- Provide feedback to the user about the connection status and message sending process.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. Start by creating a new Anvil app and designing the chat interface using Anvil's visual editor. Add text boxes for entering messages, labels for displaying chat history, and a button for sending messages.
2. Import the required modules from Anvil and Paho MQTT library in the Anvil code editor. Define functions for handling MQTT connection, message arrival, and disconnection.
3. Prompt the user to enter their name using a text box when the chat window is opened. Store the user's name in local storage for future sessions.
4. Initialize the MQTT client with a unique client ID and connect to the EMQX MQTT broker using the `setup_mqtt()` function.
5. Implement the functionality to send messages when the user clicks the send button or presses enter. Check for errors such as missing user name or uninitialized MQTT client before sending messages.
6. Subscribe to the chat topic to receive messages from other users. Display received messages in the chat interface with the sender's name and message content.
7. Scroll the chat window to show the latest messages automatically using the `scroll_into_view()` function.
8. Disconnect the MQTT client when the chat window is closed or the user navigates away using the `form_hide()` function. Handle any connection errors or interruptions gracefully.

By following these steps, you can create a real-time chat application with Anvil, MQTT, and EMQX that allows users to exchange messages seamlessly in a chat room environment.
